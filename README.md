# Steps to setup a new machine:

## Start a brand new installation:
This will install zsh, homebrew and git and download this repo under `~/.dotfiles`, then run `~/.dotfiles/install.sh`
- `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michelgrootjans/dotfiles/HEAD/init.sh)"`

## Refresh an existing installation:
- `~/.dotfiles/install.sh`
